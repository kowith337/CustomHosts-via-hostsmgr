# Just another custom hosts file
This aim to...
- Support only any apps or tools that can download one hosts file at a time! _(e.g. [NetGuard](https://github.com/M66B/NetGuard), [Lightning Browser](https://github.com/anthonycr/Lightning-Browser) v5.0.x and above)_
- Support Thai users who want to block unwanted connections, both from Thai sites and common sites. (e.g. Facebook, YouTube, Google, etc.)

I don't have or don't know any kind of automation, sorry if I didn't update this repo frequently enough.

All credits and license goes to upstream, both hosts file sources and binary that I'm using...

## Warning before use!
If you are...
- Read the news and/or article directly from big brother's search engine results, with the lightweigh load from the big brother's engine called `AMP`!
- Let the big brother suggest the word to searching something, while you're submitting keystroke to them! (Yes, every letters you've typed!!)
- Let the popular (by force) browser on the Android :tm: devices suggest article everytime before you're start going somewhere of internet.
  - Note that it's will be effective if you've disabled [Asynchronous DNS resolver](https://github.com/ookangzheng/blahdns/blob/master/FAQ.md#prevent-dns-leaking-from-chrome-browser-on-android-phone) flags inside that browser!
- Stuck at some site that still rely to connecting to proper ads and/or tracking servers before getting/reading/viewing/watching contents.
- Want to allow YouTube to save your watched history, partially watched video that remember position before you leave, etc.
- Using Facebook (either for free or not) over mobile data that your carrier have the `Free Basics` service available.
- Integrate or login with your Facebook accounts into third party apps and/or games.
- Rarely or never browsing some Thai websites.

Then this hosts file may not suitable for you, and I won't whitelist for unbreak unless the hosts aren't related to any ads and/or tracking services.

That's all!
