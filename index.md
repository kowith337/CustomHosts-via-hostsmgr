# Just another custom hosts file
This aim to...
- Support only any apps or tools that can download one hosts file at a time! _([NetGuard](https://github.com/M66B/NetGuard) for example)_
- Support Thai users who want to block unwanted connections, both from Thai sites and common sites. (e.g. Facebook, YouTube, Google, etc.)

I don't have or don't know any kind of automation, sorry if I didn't update this repo frequently enough.

All credits and license goes to upstream, both hosts file sources and binary that I'm using...

## Warning before use!
If you are...
- Stuck at some site that still rely to connecting to proper ads and/or tracking servers before getting/reading/viewing/watching contents.
- Read the news and/or article directly from big brother's search engine results, with the lightweigh load from the big brother's engine called `AMP`!
- Want to allow YouTube to save your watched history, partially watched video that remember position before you leave, etc.
- Using Facebook (either for free or not) over mobile data that your carrier have the `Free Basics` service available.
- Rarely or never browsing some Thai websites.

Then this hosts file may not suitable for you, and I won't whitelist for unbreak unless the hosts aren't related to any ads and/or tracking services.

That's all!
