# Just another custom hosts file
This aim to...
- Support to any apps and/or tools that can download one hosts file at a time! _(e.g. [NetGuard](https://github.com/M66B/NetGuard), [Lightning Browser](https://github.com/anthonycr/Lightning-Browser) v5.0.x and above)_
- Support Thai users who want to block unwanted connections, both from Thai sites and common sites. (e.g. Facebook, YouTube, Google, etc.)

I don't have or don't know any kind of automation, sorry if I didn't update this repo frequently enough.

All credits and license goes to upstream, both hosts file sources and binary that I'm using...

## Warning before use!
If you are...
- Rarely or never browsing some Thai websites.
- Use these feature in popular (by force) browser in Android :tm: system...
  - Use their data saving while use that browser.
  - Download suggested articles and read them offline.
  - Allow it to retrieve suggest article and websites everytime before you're start browsing internet by your own.
  - Save and sync your forms and credentials (aka. `passwords`) accross devices within that browser, also mobile OS system-wide auto fill.
- Integrate or login with your `Facebook` accounts into third party apps and/or games.
- Using `Facebook` (either **for free or not**) over mobile data that your carrier have the `Free Basics` service available.
- Want to allow `YouTube` to save your watched history, partially watched video that remember position before you leave, etc.
- Stuck at some site that still rely to connecting to proper ads and/or tracking servers before getting/reading/viewing/watching contents.
- Let the big brother suggest the word to searching something, while you're submitting keystroke to them! (Yes, every letters you've typed!!)
- Read the news and/or article directly from big brother's search engine results, with the lightweigh load from the big brother's engine called `AMP`!

Then this hosts file may not suitable for you, and I won't whitelist for unbreak unless the hosts aren't related to any ads and/or tracking services.

That's all!

> Please note that if you're still using `Google Chrome` and found out that it doesn't block anyting, maybe it's will be effective if you've config to disable these features below...
> - ~~[Asynchronous DNS resolver](https://github.com/ookangzheng/blahdns/tree/master/FAQ.md#prevent-dns-leaking-from-chrome-browser-on-android-phone) flags~~
> - Internal `Data Saver` that proxy everything and compress all resources that extended quota for some limited mobile data plan.
> - Secure DNS (aka. `DoH`), you should **turn off** completely, not let it left automatic.
> 
> As well if your phone are running Android 9+ or above, make sure you've disable **Private DNS** (aka. native DoT) in phone settings, too!

Otherwise, here's a choice of browser forks that respect privacy enough...

#### Chromium forks
- [Bromite](https://github.com/bromite/bromite)
- [DroidChrome](https://github.com/macchrome/droidchrome/releases) (aka. Marmaduke's Chromium)
- [Ungoogled Chromium for Android](https://git.droidware.info/wchen342/ungoogled-chromium-android)
- [Mulch](https://gitlab.com/divested-mobile/mulch)
- [Ungoogled Chromium](https://github.com/macchrome?tab=repositories) (Multi-OS)

#### Firefox forks
- [Iceraven](https://github.com/fork-maintainers/iceraven-browser)
- [Mull Fenix](https://gitlab.com/divested-mobile/mull-fenix)
- [IceCat](https://github.com/muslayev/icecat-win64) (WinPC)
- [Iceweasel](https://github.com/muslayev/iceweasel-win64) (WinPC)
- [Librewolf](https://gitlab.com/librewolf-community/browser) (Multi-OS PC)

### Why turn off secure/private DNS?
- With default (automatic) settings, it's mostly connect to well-know big companies, e.g. `CloudFlare` `XFinity`, and also `Google` itself!
- Even you've changed to other DoT/DoH servers, it's mean you've lost protection since every DNS requests are passed to system DoT and/or in-browser DoH endpoint, not any protection apps or clients!
