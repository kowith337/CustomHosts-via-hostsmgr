# Just another custom hosts file
This aim to...
- Support to any apps and/or tools that can download one hosts file at a time! _(e.g. [NetGuard](https://github.com/M66B/NetGuard), [Lightning Browser](https://github.com/anthonycr/Lightning-Browser) v5.0.x and above)_
- Support Thai users who want to block unwanted connections, both from Thai sites and common sites. (e.g. Facebook, YouTube, Google, etc.)

I don't have or don't know any kind of automation, sorry if I didn't update this repo frequently enough.

All credits and license goes to upstream, both hosts file sources and binary that I'm using...

## Warning before use!
If you are...
- Rarely or never browsing some Thai websites.
- Use these feature in popular (by force) browser in Android :tm: system...
  - Use their data saving while use that browser.
  - Download suggested articles and read them offline.
  - Save and sync your credentials (aka. `passwords`) accross devices within that browser.
  - Allow it to retrieve suggest article and websites everytime before you're start browsing internet by your own.
- Integrate or login with your `Facebook` accounts into third party apps and/or games.
- Using `Facebook` (either **for free or not**) over mobile data that your carrier have the `Free Basics` service available.
- Want to allow YouTube to save your watched history, partially watched video that remember position before you leave, etc.
- Stuck at some site that still rely to connecting to proper ads and/or tracking servers before getting/reading/viewing/watching contents.
- Let the big brother suggest the word to searching something, while you're submitting keystroke to them! (Yes, every letters you've typed!!)
- Read the news and/or article directly from big brother's search engine results, with the lightweigh load from the big brother's engine called `AMP`!

Then this hosts file may not suitable for you, and I won't whitelist for unbreak unless the hosts aren't related to any ads and/or tracking services.

That's all!

> Please note that if you're still using `Google Chrome` and found out that it doesn't block anyting, maybe it's will be effective if you've config to disable these features below...
> - ~~[Asynchronous DNS resolver](https://github.com/ookangzheng/blahdns/tree/master/FAQ.md#prevent-dns-leaking-from-chrome-browser-on-android-phone) flags~~
> - Internal `Data Saver` that proxy everything and compress all resources that extended quota for some limited mobile data plan.
> - Secure DNS (aka. `DoH`), you should **turn off** completely, not let it left automatic.

### Why turn off secure DNS lookup?
With default (automatic) settings, it's mostly connect to well-know big companies, e.g. `CloudFlare` `XFinity`, and also `Google` itself!
