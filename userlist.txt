# Pull from "aggressive" because someone ruining me and
# it seems he probably didn't even read my notes and keep
# report issues, even I've move some of compromised domains
# into aggressive lists that he shouldn't file any issues
# if it's already in that list!
# So what's the point of him for using my lists, even
# aggressive one?
